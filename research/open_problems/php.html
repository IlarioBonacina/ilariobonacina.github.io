    <p>Are minimal size resolution proofs of \(\mathsf{PHP}^{n+1}_n\) regular? (see for instance Conjecture 6.1 in <a class="citation" href="#AJPU07">[1]</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The formula \(\mathsf{PHP}^{n+1}_n\) has regular resolution refutations of size \(n(n+3)2^{n-2}\) (see <a class="citation" href="#Cook76">[2]</a>). Is this bound tight? <em>I.e.</em>, is \(n(n+3)2^{n-1}\) the minimal size of a resolution proof of \(\mathsf{PHP}^{n+1}_n\)? (see for insatnce Conjecture 6.2 in <a class="citation" href="#AJPU07">[1]</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let \(S(n)\) be the minimal size of a resolution refutation of \(\mathsf{PHP}^m_n\). What is the value of \(\eta=\lim\sup_{n\to \infty}\frac{\log_2\log_2 S(n)}{\log_2 n}\)? From Theorem 4 of <a class="citation" href="#BP98">[3]</a> and Corollary 7 of <a class="citation" href="#R04a">[4]</a> we have \(\eta\in (\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For every constant \(c&gt;1\) and \(n\) sufficiently large, \(k\)-DNF resolution refutations of \(\mathsf{PHP}^{cn}_n\) must have size at least
\(\mathrm{e}^{n/(\log n)^{\mathcal{O}(k)}}\) (see Theorem 2.15 of <a class="citation" href="#R.15">[5]</a>)
Is the same bound true for the <em>onto-functional</em> pigeonhole principle \(\mathsf{ofPHP}^{cn}_n\)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prove that \(2\)-DNF resolution refutations of \(\mathsf{PHP}^{n^2}_n\) must have size at least \(n^{\omega(1)}\). The largest \(m\) for which we have a superpolynomial (actually exponential) lower bound is \(m\approx n^{9/8-\epsilon}\), this is due to Theorem 3.1 in <a class="citation" href="#ABE02">[6]</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prove that depth-\(d\) Frege refutations of \(\mathsf{PHP}^{2n}_n\) must have size at least \(n^{\omega(1)}\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that polynomial calculus refutations of \(\mathsf{PHP}^m_n\) must have size at least \(2^{\Omega(n)}\) regardless of the ground field \(\mathbb{F}\) and for any \(m\) (Corollary 6.8 in <a class="citation" href="#IPS.99">[7]</a>). Prove an \(n^{\omega(1)}\) size lower bound for \(\mathsf{PHP}^m_n\) in polynomial calculus + resolution when \(m\geq n^2\). For  \(m&lt;n^2\) we do have \(2^{\Omega(n)}\) lower bounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given any prime \(p\) is it true that refutations of \(\mathsf{PHP}^{m}_n\) in \(\mathsf{res}(\mathsf{lin}_p)\), i.e. resolution on linear equations modulo \(p\), must have size \(n^{\omega(1)}\)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prove \(n^{\omega(1)}\) size lower bounds for the \(G\text{-}\mathsf{PHP}\) over an expander graph with \(m\) pigeons, each of them could fly to \(\Delta\) holes and the expansion is \(c\Delta\) for \(c\) constant. We know exponential results for \(c=1-o(1)\) (see <a class="citation" href="#dRNRS.20">[8]</a>).</p>
